# SocioDAO

A DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) can be designed as a society that allows members to buy properties listed on the platform, which in turn grants them voting powers in the proposals of the society. The society aims to be a democratic and decentralized organization, where decisions are made by its members through voting.

To become a member of the society, interested individuals need to verify their identity by entering their Aadhar number. This step ensures that only genuine members are granted access to the society's platform and that the voting process is fair and transparent.

Once verified, members can purchase properties that are listed on the platform. Properties can be anything from a piece of land to a house or an apartment. Each property purchase grants the buyer a token as proof of ownership, which also grants the buyer voting power in the proposals of the society. The society's proposals can range from decisions about the development of properties, the introduction of new rules and regulations, and community events, among others. Members can submit proposals, vote on proposals, and contribute to the development of the society.
